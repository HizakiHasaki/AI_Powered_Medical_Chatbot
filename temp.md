INFO:__main__:Processed response from GPT-4 Vision API: The encoders in the picture are represented on the left side and consist of:

1. **Input Embedding**: Transforms inputs into embeddings.
2. **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to the embeddings.
3. **Multi-Head Attention**: Applies attention to capture dependencies across the input.
4. **Add & Norm**: Residual connection followed by layer normalization.
5. **Feed Forward**: A fully connected feed-forward network applied to the outputs of the previous step.
6. **Add & Norm**: Another residual connection and normalization.

The entire encoder stack is repeated `NX` times as specified.
